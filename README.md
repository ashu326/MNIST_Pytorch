# MNIST Using PyTorch

MNIST problem is like a Hello World of deep learning at this point, and probably everyone who is interested in neural nets goes through it eventually. So, here is my take on it. And I will be using PyTorch to solve it. I haven't yet found a detailed solution of the MNIST with PyTorch on Kaggle, so I figured I'd make my own one.

I will be using fully connected neural net and batched learning algorithm. This model is far from perfect, but I tried to make it as simple as it gets and explain every step of this solution. If you are a beginner and interested in PyTorch, hopefully, this will be helpful to you.
